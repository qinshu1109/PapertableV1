/**
 * Permission-request bridge: DSH `approval/request` → WeChat text prompt.
 *
 * WeChat personal accounts have no buttons, so a permission request is
 * rendered as a numbered text prompt and resolved by `/yes` or `/no` (bare
 * `1`/`2` also work while exactly one request is pending). A reply timeout
 * falls back to DSH's default deny (`'rejected'`), matching the spec:
 * timeout → deny.
 *
 * The bridge only answers for agents the conversation node drives (the
 * active session); every other request delegates via `next()`.
